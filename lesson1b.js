//in javascript, we need to have an initializer before declaring a variable. In ES6 we have two main types of initializers i.e:

// let: It declares values which can be changed later on.
let weight = 10.5
console.log(weight)

//const : It is ued to declare variables which contain values that are not intended to be changed in the entire program
const pi = 3.142
console.log("the pi is",pi)
